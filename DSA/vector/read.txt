vector do this when we fill the data in block it got full, it directly double the block for example if previous array size is 4 then 
it will double its size to 8 if it got fill thats the main focus for using vector

its used for dynamic array not static one

for more reference use this website-

to add this in file use this #include<vector>

agar koi file insert krna chate to we use

-> for insert - push_back()
like vector <int> arr;
arr.push_back(5);

-> to remove- pop_back()

-> to check size - arr.size()

-> to check capacity (how many element it can store) - arr.capacity()

-> to check it is empty or not - arr.empty()- it will return true or false
