int arr[row][col] - 2d matrix

to get exact number of the element we will do col*ith row*jth col

see always remember when you make function with 2d array the value inside of 2d array in function should be same as value during
initialization of array inside main()
like

void example(int arr[][10])
{

}
int main()
{
    int arr[][10];
}

-> Now if we going to use vector for 2d array we will do like this
syntax - vector<vector<int> >arr;

->we will access arr like normal one, like this arr[][]

-> Now question arise how you make 3x4 matrix inside vector
vector<vector<int> > arr(3,vector<int>(4));
    //<int> > dono brackett ke beech space rakhna


int row=3;
int col=5;

->  vector<vector<int> >arr(row,vector<int>(col,69));
    // this line means 3 row 5 col value filled with 69 , col is size of inner vector

    // vector<vector<int> >arr(n,0) means 2d int array banana
    -> n means size,0 means initialised value
