code -

#include<vector>
#include<algorithm>
using namespace std;

{
    for(int i=0;i<size;i++)

    }
    cout<<"Enter second list "<<endl;
    for(int j=0;j<m;j++)
    {
        cin>>brr[j];
    }
    vector<int>both;
    add(n,both,arr);
    add(m,both,brr);
    cout<<"Print unique list"<<endl;
    unique(both);
    return 0;
    

}


question - Its not printing anything
solution - 
void add(int size,vector<int>both,vector<int>a)
{
    for(int i=0;i<size;i++)
    {
        both.push_back(a[i]);
    }
}

is there something wrong here?

Yes, there is an issue in the add function you've provided. The issue is that you're passing the both vector by value,
 which means that any changes you make to it inside the function won't affect the original vector outside the function. 
 To solve this, you need to pass the both vector by [reference]. <-

Here's the corrected version of the add function:

void add(int size, vector<int> &both, const vector<int> &a)
{
    for (int i = 0; i < size; i++)
    {
        both.push_back(a[i]);
    }
}
Note the & symbol before both and a in the function signature. This indicates that you're passing the vectors by reference, 
so any changes you make to them inside the function will be reflected outside the function.

Additionally, I've added the const keyword before vector<int> &a to indicate that the a vector is being passed as a constant reference
, which means it won't be modified inside the add function.

Make sure to update the function call in your main function accordingly:


add(n, both, arr);
add(m, both, brr);
With these changes, the modifications made to the both vector inside the add function will correctly affect the original 
both vector outside the function.


in short just add '&' before giving vector name like vector<int> &both

Question - 
why it worked and when we needed to put it as in past when i was passing array inside the function i dont need to put & 
but why we needed it in vector??

answer -
Great question! Understanding when and why to use the `&` symbol (passing by reference) can be a bit nuanced,
 especially when dealing with different types like arrays and vectors. Let's break it down:

1. **Arrays:** When you pass an array to a function, you're actually passing a pointer to the array's first element.
 This means that any changes made to the array inside the function will affect the original array outside the function.
 This is why you don't need to use the `&` symbol when passing arrays â€“ they're already being passed by reference
 (technically by pointer).

    Example:
    ```cpp
    void modifyArray(int arr[], int size) {
        arr[0] = 100; // This modification will reflect in the original array
    }
    ```

2. **Vectors:** Vectors are more complex than arrays. When you pass a vector to a function, by default, you're passing a copy of the
    vector, not the original vector itself. So any changes made to the vector inside the function will not affect the original vector
     outside the function. To modify the original vector inside the function, you need to pass it by reference using the `&` symbol.

    Example:
    ```cpp
    void modifyVector(vector<int> vec) {
        vec[0] = 100; // This modification won't affect the original vector
    }
    
    void modifyVectorByReference(vector<int> &vec) {
        vec[0] = 100; // This modification will affect the original vector
    }
    ```

In the code you were working with, the `add` function was designed to modify the `both` vector by adding elements to it. 
To ensure that these modifications affected the original `both` vector outside the function, you needed to pass the `both` vector by 
reference using the `&` symbol.

In summary, whether you need to use the `&` symbol depends on the behavior you want and the data type you're working with. 
For vectors and other types where you want changes to be reflected outside the function, passing by reference is the way to go.

Question: when to use reference how to iter in array 2 ways
for example in our question we have to change letter a with y in given string

way-1
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    string n = "hari hari ram";

    for (char& c : n)
    {
        if (c == 'a')  // Corrected comparison and character assignment
        {
            c = 'y';  // Corrected assignment
        }
    }

    for (char c : n)
    {
        cout << c;
    }

    return 0;
}


way-2

#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    string n = "rayanaaaa";

    for(int i = 0; i < n.size(); i++)
    {
        char& ch = n[i];  // Use a reference to modify the character
        if(ch == 'a')
        {
            ch = 'y';
        }
    }

    for(char ch : n)
    {
        cout << ch;
    }

    return 0;
}

Question - now why char& ch why using reference?
ans- 
    In the corrected code, a reference (`char& ch`) is used to modify the characters in the string. 
    The use of a reference is necessary to ensure that the modifications made to the characters inside the loop persist 
    and reflect in the original string `n`.

In C++, when you iterate over a string using a for loop like this:

    ```cpp
    for (int i = 0; i < n.size(); i++)
    {
        char ch = n[i];
        // ...
    }
    ```

    The `char ch` creates a copy of each character from the string, and modifications to `ch` won't affect the original string `n`. 
    To modify the original string, we use a reference:

    ```cpp
    for (int i = 0; i < n.size(); i++)
    {
        char& ch = n[i];  // Use a reference to the actual character in the string
        // ...
    }
    ```

    By using `char& ch`, we're creating a reference to the actual character in the string, so any 
    modifications to `ch` will directly modify the corresponding character in the original string `n`.

    Without using a reference, any changes made to `ch` inside the loop won't affect the original string. 
    Using a reference ensures that the modifications persist and are reflected in the original string.
