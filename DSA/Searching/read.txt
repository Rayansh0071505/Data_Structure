-> Binary Search 

in the binary search it divides the array into 2 halves and later on keep dividing it untill it found the searching element
better than linear search
condition-:
1) Array should be in sorted order

It also heve stl predefine function
like 
-> syntax
    #include<algorithm>
    vector<int> a{1,2,3,4,5}
    binary_search(a.begin(),a.end(),key) - key means number to be searched

-> syntax for array 
    #include<algorithm>
    int a=[1,2,3,4,5,6]
    binary_search(a,a+size,key) - key means number to be searched
    // it will be like binary_search(base address for start, base address+size for end, key need to be searched)
